# Music Genre Classification

Music Genre Classification is a task within the field of Music Information Retrieval. Over time,
different techniques have been developed to perform this task, starting from classical algorithms followed by
the use of deep learning techniques in the last few years. In the present project, we discuss how prepare the
data when dealing with audio files, we evaluate the different features that can be extracted. Then, we analyze
different classical algorithm, such as SVM or XGBoosting and some Deep Learning techniques, such as CNN
or RCNN. We will use the GTZAN dataset, the most popular database in this area, for all the models in order
to be able to compare them with each other.


The repository is organized as follows:

3. src folder contains
  a. demo.ipynb 
  b. feature visualization + MFCC feature extraction + build, train save and plot results on classical models
4. trained_Classical_models contains: 
  a. some classical pretrained models .sav files
5. Deep_learning_models contain all the deep learning models and their assoicated code.
